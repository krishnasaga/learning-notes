### formation of RNA

** Think about a simple molucule **
To form water molecule H2O you need hydrogen and Oxygen. We have an abundant amount of them in this universe, and given the right circumstances, they are easy to form. Not so surprising that is highly likely. 

- Chances of flipping a coin landing on heads.  P = 0.5. 50% chance
- Chances of flipping a coin landing on heads 10 times in a row in one attempt. 
- Chances of getting 10 heads in a row after 1000 attempts ?
- Chances of getting 10 heads in a row after 1000000 attempts ?

When number of attempts increase chances are geting better
