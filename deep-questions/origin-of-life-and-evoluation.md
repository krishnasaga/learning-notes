Transition from non-living to living entities

In 1944, Austrian physicist Erwin Schr√∂dinger defined life as that which resists decaying to disorder and equilibrium. This definition relates to the second law of thermodynamics, which states that closed systems will naturally gain entropy, or disorder, over time.

## Explanation 1 
Abiogenesis

### formation of RNA

** Think about a simple molucule **
To form water molecule H2O you need hydrogen and Oxygen. We have an abundant amount of them in this universe, and given the right circumstances, they are easy to form. Not so surprising that is highly likely. 

- Chances of flipping a coin landing on heads.  P = 0.5. 50% chance
- Chances of flipping a coin landing on heads 10 times in a row in one attempt. 
- Chances of getting 10 heads in a row after 1000 attempts ?
- Chances of getting 10 heads in a row after 1000000 attempts ?

When number of attempts increase chances are geting better
