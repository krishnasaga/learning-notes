# Power vs Virtues

Power refers to the ability to influence or control others, whether through physical force, wealth, social status, or other means. Power can be used for both positive and negative purposes, and it often involves the ability to make decisions or take actions that affect others.

Virtues, on the other hand, are qualities of character or behavior that are considered to be morally good or praiseworthy. Virtues include things like honesty, compassion, courage, and wisdom, and they are often seen as essential for living a fulfilling and meaningful life. Unlike power, virtues cannot be gained or lost through external means, and they are not necessarily related to social status or influence.

While power can be used to achieve certain goals or objectives, virtues are often seen as more important for creating a just and harmonious society. People who possess virtues are often more respected and admired than those who wield power without regard for morality or ethics. Ultimately, virtues are considered to be a more enduring and meaningful source of personal and social well-being than power.

## Exploring the views of great people in history

I like to start exploring this by going through views of some great people in history and presnt world

### Dante Alighieri 

"Consider your origins: you were not made to live as brutes, but to follow virtue and knowledge."

Dante Alighieri, the Italian poet and philosopher of the Late Middle Ages, had much to say about power in his famous work, "The Divine Comedy". In this epic poem, Dante explored the nature of power and its impact on individuals and society.

One of the most notable aspects of Dante's views on power is his belief that power must be exercised in accordance with the principles of justice and morality. In his view, rulers who abuse their power or act unjustly are not only harming their subjects but also damaging their own souls. Dante believed that rulers have a duty to use their power to promote the common good and ensure that justice is upheld, rather than simply pursuing their own interests or desires.

Dante also emphasized the dangers of excessive ambition and the desire for power. He believed that individuals who seek power for its own sake are likely to become corrupted and lose sight of their moral responsibilities. In his famous depiction of Hell, Dante reserved a special place for those who had abused their power, including corrupt politicians and religious leaders.

Overall, Dante's views on power reflect his deep concern for justice and morality, as well as his belief in the importance of individual virtue and responsibility. His work continues to be studied and admired today as a testament to the enduring significance of these themes.
