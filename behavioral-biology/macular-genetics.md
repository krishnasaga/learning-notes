## Exceptions of central dogma theroy
A known exception is retroviruses, which transcribe RNA into DNA through the use of a special enzyme called reverse transcriptase has resulted in an exception to the central dogma; RNA → DNA → RNA → protein.

# Evoluation 

Microevolution is about the proteins; macroevolution is about the networks.

## Microevolution
In the context of DNA protein synthesis, microevolution refers to the changes that occur over time within a population that can affect the process of protein synthesis from DNA. Here are some notes that could be useful for an exam on microevolution in DNA protein synthesis:

- Protein synthesis is the process by which cells build proteins from the information encoded in DNA. This process involves transcription, in which the DNA code is transcribed into RNA, and translation, in which the RNA code is translated into a protein.

- Microevolutionary changes can affect both transcription and translation, altering the sequence or structure of the RNA or protein product.
One mechanism of microevolution in DNA protein synthesis is the accumulation of mutations in the DNA sequence, which can affect the sequence or structure of the RNA or protein product. For example, a point mutation in the DNA code can change the amino acid sequence of the resulting protein, potentially altering its structure or function.

- Natural selection can act on these microevolutionary changes, favoring those mutations that confer an advantage in the environment, such as improved protein function or altered regulation of gene expression.

- Another mechanism of microevolution in DNA protein synthesis is the evolution of new genes or proteins with novel functions or specificities, which can interact with DNA in new ways and alter the process of protein synthesis. Gene duplication, followed by divergence and functional specialization, can give rise to new genes or proteins with unique functions or regulatory properties.

- Microevolutionary changes in DNA protein synthesis can have important implications for the development of diseases, such as those caused by mutations in genes that encode proteins involved in protein synthesis, such as ribosomal proteins or translation factors.

- Understanding microevolution in DNA protein synthesis is important for elucidating the mechanisms of gene regulation and protein function, and for the development of new therapies and diagnostic tools for diseases.

- Overall, microevolution in DNA protein synthesis is a dynamic process that occurs constantly within populations and contributes to the diversity of proteins and cellular functions in all living organisms.

## Macroevolution

From ROBERT SAPOLSKY notes

As promoters change, transcription factors change. Splicing enzymes can change their behavior and create entirely new proteins. Changes in transcription factors can activate entirely different gene sequences. Little changes can have big results, especially when those changes cascade.

### Transcription factors
Transcription factors are proteins involved in the process of converting, or transcribing, DNA into RNA.

### Splicing enzymes
The RNA-splicing endonuclease is an evolutionarily conserved enzyme responsible for the excision of introns from nuclear transfer RNA (tRNA) and all archaeal RNAs.
