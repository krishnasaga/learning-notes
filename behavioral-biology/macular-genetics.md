## Central Dogma of life

The central dogma of life is a fundamental concept in molecular biology that describes the flow of genetic information in living organisms. The central dogma states that genetic information flows from DNA to RNA to proteins in a unidirectional manner. Here are some key points that elaborate on this concept:

- DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid) is a double-stranded molecule that contains the genetic information for an organism. DNA is organized into genes, which are segments of DNA that code for specific proteins.

- The first step in the central dogma is transcription, which is the process by which a gene is copied from DNA to RNA (ribonucleic acid). During transcription, an enzyme called RNA polymerase reads the DNA sequence of a gene and synthesizes a complementary RNA copy.

- The RNA molecule that is synthesized during transcription is called messenger RNA (mRNA). mRNA serves as a template for protein synthesis and carries the genetic information from the DNA to the ribosomes, which are the cellular organelles that synthesize proteins.

- The second step in the central dogma is translation, which is the process by which the genetic information in mRNA is used to synthesize a protein. During translation, the mRNA is read by ribosomes, which assemble amino acids into a chain to form a protein.

- The sequence of nucleotides in DNA determines the sequence of nucleotides in mRNA, which in turn determines the sequence of amino acids in a protein. The genetic code is a set of rules that specifies how the sequence of nucleotides in mRNA is translated into the sequence of amino acids in a protein.

- The central dogma is considered "central" because it describes the basic mechanism by which genetic information is transferred from DNA to proteins, which are the molecular building blocks of life. This process is essential for the growth, development, and function of all living organisms.

- While the central dogma provides a basic framework for understanding the flow of genetic information, it is important to note that there are exceptions to this process. For example, some viruses use RNA as their genetic material, and some RNA molecules can have catalytic activity and function as enzymes.

- Overall, the central dogma of life is a foundational concept in molecular biology that explains how genetic information is transferred from DNA to proteins, and how this process underlies the development, growth, and function of living organisms.

## Exceptions of central dogma theroy
A known exception is retroviruses, which transcribe RNA into DNA through the use of a special enzyme called reverse transcriptase has resulted in an exception to the central dogma; RNA → DNA → RNA → protein.

# Evoluation 

Microevolution is about the proteins; macroevolution is about the networks.

## Microevolution
In the context of DNA protein synthesis, microevolution refers to the changes that occur over time within a population that can affect the process of protein synthesis from DNA. Here are some notes that could be useful for an exam on microevolution in DNA protein synthesis:

- Protein synthesis is the process by which cells build proteins from the information encoded in DNA. This process involves transcription, in which the DNA code is transcribed into RNA, and translation, in which the RNA code is translated into a protein.

- Microevolutionary changes can affect both transcription and translation, altering the sequence or structure of the RNA or protein product.
One mechanism of microevolution in DNA protein synthesis is the accumulation of mutations in the DNA sequence, which can affect the sequence or structure of the RNA or protein product. For example, a point mutation in the DNA code can change the amino acid sequence of the resulting protein, potentially altering its structure or function.

- Natural selection can act on these microevolutionary changes, favoring those mutations that confer an advantage in the environment, such as improved protein function or altered regulation of gene expression.

- Another mechanism of microevolution in DNA protein synthesis is the evolution of new genes or proteins with novel functions or specificities, which can interact with DNA in new ways and alter the process of protein synthesis. Gene duplication, followed by divergence and functional specialization, can give rise to new genes or proteins with unique functions or regulatory properties.

- Microevolutionary changes in DNA protein synthesis can have important implications for the development of diseases, such as those caused by mutations in genes that encode proteins involved in protein synthesis, such as ribosomal proteins or translation factors.

- Understanding microevolution in DNA protein synthesis is important for elucidating the mechanisms of gene regulation and protein function, and for the development of new therapies and diagnostic tools for diseases.

- Overall, microevolution in DNA protein synthesis is a dynamic process that occurs constantly within populations and contributes to the diversity of proteins and cellular functions in all living organisms.

## Macroevolution

From ROBERT SAPOLSKY notes

"As promoters change, transcription factors change. Splicing enzymes can change their behavior and create entirely new proteins. Changes in transcription factors can activate entirely different gene sequences. Little changes can have big results, especially when those changes cascade."


This statement highlights the important role of microevolution in shaping the regulation and expression of genes. Here are some further notes that expand upon this idea:

- Promoters are regions of DNA that signal to the transcriptional machinery where to begin transcribing a particular gene. Changes in the DNA sequence of a promoter can alter its binding affinity for transcription factors, which in turn can affect the level of gene expression.

- Transcription factors are proteins that bind to specific DNA sequences and regulate the transcription of nearby genes. Changes in the DNA sequence of a gene can alter the binding affinity of transcription factors, which can activate or repress the transcription of the gene.

- Splicing enzymes are proteins that catalyze the removal of introns and the joining of exons in pre-mRNA to create mature mRNA. Changes in the splicing machinery can result in alternative splicing, which can generate different mRNA isoforms that encode different protein products.

- Changes in transcription factors or splicing enzymes can be caused by mutations in the genes that encode them or by changes in their expression or activity levels. These changes can alter the regulation and expression of genes and generate new protein isoforms with novel functions.

- Little changes in DNA sequence or gene expression can have big results, especially when those changes cascade through regulatory networks. A small change in a promoter sequence can alter the binding of a transcription factor, which can activate or repress the expression of multiple downstream genes. - - - Similarly, changes in splicing enzymes can affect the alternative splicing of multiple genes, generating new protein isoforms with distinct functions.

- Microevolutionary changes in gene regulation and expression can have important consequences for the evolution of species and the development of diseases. 

- For example, changes in the expression or activity of transcription factors can lead to the evolution of novel traits or the development of cancer, while changes in splicing can cause genetic disorders such as cystic fibrosis or beta-thalassemia.

- Overall, microevolutionary changes in gene regulation and expression can have far-reaching effects on the structure and function of proteins and on the phenotype of organisms.


### Transcription factors
Transcription factors are proteins involved in the process of converting, or transcribing, DNA into RNA.

- Proteins that regulate gene expression by binding to specific DNA sequences in the promoter region.

- They can activate or repress gene expression by recruiting other proteins or interacting with RNA polymerase.

- There are different types of transcription factors, which are involved in regulating the expression of multiple genes or specific genes.

- The activity of transcription factors is regulated by post-translational modifications.

- Mutations or changes in the expression of transcription factors can lead to developmental abnormalities, cancer, and other diseases.

- Transcription factors are important targets for drug development and gene therapy.

- Understanding transcription factors is crucial for the proper functioning of living organisms and has implications for medicine and biotechnology.

### Splicing enzymes
The RNA-splicing endonuclease is an evolutionarily conserved enzyme responsible for the excision of introns from nuclear transfer RNA (tRNA) and all archaeal RNAs.
