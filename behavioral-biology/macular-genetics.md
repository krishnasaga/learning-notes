Microevolution is about the proteins; macroevolution is about the networks.

## Microevolution

## Macroevolution

From ROBERT SAPOLSKY notes

As promoters change, transcription factors change. Splicing enzymes can change their behavior and create entirely new proteins. Changes in transcription factors can activate entirely different gene sequences. Little changes can have big results, especially when those changes cascade.

### Transcription factors
Transcription factors are proteins involved in the process of converting, or transcribing, DNA into RNA.

### Splicing enzymes
The RNA-splicing endonuclease is an evolutionarily conserved enzyme responsible for the excision of introns from nuclear transfer RNA (tRNA) and all archaeal RNAs.
